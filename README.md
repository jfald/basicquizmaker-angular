# Intro
This is part 2/2 for a working Quiz app. This is still in the initial stages of development but it is working without error.
I wanted to do this app to learn more about integrating Angular with Mongo.

More documentation coming.

# Development notes
I followed a tutorial [here](https://medium.com/@nomanbinhussein/mean-app-tutorial-with-angular-4-part-2-4250522c845) but instead of making a ToDo app I changed it to make a Quiz app. It wasn't the best tutorial because of out-of-date code syntax (which caused runtime errors), saying to test out the code mid way through but errors occured because additional code was needed that wasn't introduced until later, duplicate code in one html file example, and it didn't seem to take advantage of Angular best practices (based on going through an Angular tutorial previously.) But it got me started and after working through errors I have a working app. I will probably go back and change some of code to make future development easier.
